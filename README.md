## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a 3D solar system using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), featuring:
- The Sun with glow and flare
- All 8 planets with realistic textures and orbits
- Real-time speed controls
- Pause/Resume animation
- Zoom in/out functionality
- Light/Dark theme toggle
- Tooltips on planet hover
- Camera focus on planet click
- Background stars for realism

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### ✅ Prerequisites
- Any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- No installation needed
- Internet connection (for textures & Three.js CDN)

### 🔧 Steps

1. **Download/Unzip the project folder**
2. **Open `index.html`** in your browser
3. You’ll see the animated 3D solar system in motion

## 🎮 Features

### 🔭 Solar System in Motion
- Realistic Sun at the center with glow
- 8 textured planets orbiting in 3D
- Planets rotate at unique speeds and distances

### 🎚️ Speed Control
- Sliders to adjust each planet’s orbital speed in real time
- Updates reflect immediately in the animation loop

### 🌗 Light & Dark Mode
- Toggle button to switch between light and dark UI themes

### 🎥 Zoom In/Out
- Buttons and mouse wheel to zoom camera in/out

### ⏯ Pause/Resume Animation
- Button to toggle animation playback

### 🪐 Planet Labels
- Hover over any planet to see its name using a tooltip

### 📷 Camera Focus
- Click on a planet to zoom and center the camera on it

## 🧠 Technical Stack

| Tool       | Purpose                                  |
|------------|------------------------------------------|
| HTML       | Structure of the web page                |
| JavaScript | Logic, animation, and user interaction   |
| Three.js   | 3D rendering library                     |
| WebGL      | Underlying rendering engine via Three.js |

## 🧩 How It Works

- **Scene Setup:** A Three.js scene with a perspective camera and WebGL renderer
- **Lighting:** Ambient and point lights simulate sunlight
- **Sun Glow:** Added using `THREE.Sprite` and a flare texture
- **Planets:** Created with `THREE.SphereGeometry`, realistic textures, and orbit animation via `Object3D` pivots
- **Controls:** HTML sliders and buttons interact directly with the animation loop
- **Raycasting:** Detect mouse hover to show tooltips and camera clicks
